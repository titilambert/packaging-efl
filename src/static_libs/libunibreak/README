LIBUNIBREAK
===========

Overview
--------

This is the README file for libunibreak, an implementation of the line
breaking and word breaking algorithms as described in [Unicode Standard
Annex 14] [1] and [Unicode Standard Annex 29] [2].  Check the project's
[home page] [3] for up-to-date information.

Licence
-------

This library is released under an open-source licence, the zlib/libpng
licence.  Please check the file *LICENCE* for details.

Apart from using the algorithm, part of the code is derived from the
[Unicode Public Data] [4], and the [Unicode Terms of Use] [5] may apply.

Installation
------------

There are three ways to build the library:

1. On \*NIX systems supported by the autoconfiscation tools, do the
   normal

        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

   to build and install both the dynamic and static libraries.  In
   addition, one may
   - type `make doc` to generate the doxygen documentation; or
   - type `make linebreakdata` to regenerate *linebreakdata.c* from
     *LineBreak.txt*.
   - type `make wordbreakdata` to regenerate *wordbreakdata.c* from
     *WordBreakProperty.txt*.

2. On systems where GCC and Binutils are supported, one can type

        cd src
        cp -p Makefile.gcc Makefile
        make

   to build the static library.  In addition, one may
   - type `make debug` or `make release` to explicitly generate the
     debug or release build;
   - type `make doc` to generate the doxygen documentation; or
   - type `make linebreakdata` to regenerate *linebreakdata.c* from
     *LineBreak.txt*.
   - type `make wordbreakdata` to regenerate *wordbreakdata.c* from
     *WordBreakProperty.txt*.

3. On Windows, apart from using method 1 (Cygwin/MSYS) and method 2
   (MinGW), MSVC can also be used.  Type

        cd src
        nmake -f Makefile.msvc

   to build the static library.  By default the debug release is built.
   To build the release version

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc CFG="libunibreak - Win32 Release"
