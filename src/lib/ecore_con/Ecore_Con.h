/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Group Ecore_Con - Connection functions
 * @ingroup Ecore
 *
 * The Ecore Connection Library ( @c Ecore_Con ) provides simple mechanisms
 * for communications between programs using reliable sockets.  It saves
 * the programmer from having to worry about file descriptors and waiting
 * for incoming connections.
 *
 * There are two main objects in the @c Ecore_Con library: the @c
 * Ecore_Con_Server and the @c Ecore_Con_Client.
 *
 * The @c Ecore_Con_Server represents a server that can be connected to.
 * It is used regardless of whether the program is acting as a server or
 * client itself.
 *
 * To create a listening server call @c ecore_con_server_add(), optionally using
 * an ECORE_CON_USE_* encryption type OR'ed with the type for encryption.
 *
 * To connect to a server, call @c ecore_con_server_connect().  Data can
 * then be sent to the server using the @c ecore_con_server_send().
 *
 * Functions are described in the following groupings:
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Lib_Group
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Server_Group
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Client_Group
 * @li @ref Ecore_Con_Url_Group
 *
 * Events are described in @ref Ecore_Con_Events_Group.

/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Events_Group Ecore Connection Events Functions
 * @ingroup Ecore_Con_Group
 *
 * @li ECORE_CON_CLIENT_ADD: Whenever a client connection is made to an
 * @c Ecore_Con_Server, an event of this type is emitted, allowing the
 * retrieval of the client's ip with @ref ecore_con_client_ip_get and
 * associating data with the client using ecore_con_client_data_set.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DEL: Whenever a client connection to an
 * @c Ecore_Con_Server, an event of this type is emitted.  The contents of
 * the data with this event are variable, but if the client object in the data
 * is non-null, it must be freed with @ref ecore_con_client_del.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_ADD: Whenever a server object is created
 * with @ref ecore_con_server_connect, an event of this type is emitted,
 * allowing for data to be serialized and sent to the server using
 * @ref ecore_con_server_send. At this point, the http handshake has
 * occurred.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DEL: Whenever a server object is destroyed,
 * usually by the server connection being refused or dropped, an event of this
 * type is emitted.  The contents of the data with this event are variable,
 * but if the server object in the data is non-null, it must be freed
 * with @ref ecore_con_server_del.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DATA: Whenever a client connects to your server
 * object and sends data, an event of this type is emitted.  The data will contain both
 * the size and contents of the message sent by the client.  It should be noted that
 * data within this object is transient, so it must be duplicated in order to be
 * retained.  This event will continue to occur until the client has stopped sending its
 * message, so a good option for storing this data is an Eina_Strbuf.  Once the message has
 * been received in full, the client object must be freed with ecore_con_client_free.
 * @li ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DATA: Whenever your server object connects to its destination
 * and receives data, an event of this type is emitted.  The data will contain both
 * the size and contents of the message sent by the server.  It should be noted that
 * data within this object is transient, so it must be duplicated in order to be
 * retained.  This event will continue to occur until the server has stopped sending its
 * message, so a good option for storing this data is an Eina_Strbuf.  Once the message has
 * been received in full, the server object must be freed with ecore_con_server_free.

/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Buffer Ecore Connection Buffering
 * @ingroup Ecore_Con_Group
 * 
 * As Ecore_Con works on an event driven design, as data arrives, events will
 * be produced containing the data that arrived. It is up to the user of
 * Ecore_Con to either parse as they go, append to a file to later parse the
 * whole file in one go, or append to memory to parse or handle later.
 * 
 * To help with this Eina has some handy API's. The Eina_Binbuf and 
 * Eina_Strbuf APIs, abstract dynamic buffer management and make it trivial 
 * to handle buffers at runtime, without having to manage them. Eina_Binbuf 
 * makes it possible to create, expand, reset and slice a blob of memory - 
 * all via API. No system calls, no pointer manipulations and no size 
 * calculation.
 * 
 * Additional functions include adding content at specified byte positions in 
 * the buffer, escaping the inputs, find and replace strings. This provides 
 * extreme flexibility to play around, with a dynamic blob of memory.
 * 
 * It is good to free it (using eina_binbuf_free()) after using it.
 * 
 * Eina_Binbuf compliments Ecore_Con use cases, where dynamic sizes of data
 * arrive from the network (think http download in chunks). Using
 * Eina_Binbuf provides enough flexibility to handle data as it arrives and
 * to defer its processing until desired, without having to think about
 * where to store the temporary data and how to manage its size.
 * 
 * An example of how to use these with Ecore_Con follows.
 * 
 * @code
 * #include <Eina.h>
 * #include <Ecore.h>
 * #include <Ecore_Con.h>
 * 
 * static Eina_Bool
 * data_callback(void *data, int type, void *event)

 *    if ( url_data->size > 0)
 *      {
 *         // append data as it arrives - don't worry where or how it gets stored.
 *         // Also don't worry about size, expanding, reallocing etc.
 *         // just keep appending - size is automatically handled.
 * 
 *         eina_binbuf_append_length(data, url_data->data, url_data->size);
 * 
 *         fprintf(stderr, "Appended %d \n", url_data->size);

 *    return EINA_TRUE;

/**
 * @defgroup Ecore_Con_Server_Group Ecore Connection Server Functions
 * @ingroup Ecore_Con_Group
 *
 * This group of functions is applied to an @ref Ecore_Con_Server object. It
 * doesn't mean that they should be used in the server application, but on the
 * server object. In fact, most of them should be used in the client
 * application, when retrieving information or sending data.
 *
 * Setting up a server is very simple: you just need to start it with
 * ecore_con_server_add() and setup some callbacks to the events
 * @ref ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_ADD, @ref ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DEL and
 * @ref ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DATA, that will be called when a client is
 * communicating with the server:
 *
 * @code
 * if (!(svr = ecore_con_server_add(ECORE_CON_REMOTE_TCP, "127.0.0.1", 8080, NULL)))
 *   exit(1);
 *
 * ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_ADD, _add_cb, NULL);
 * ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DEL, _del_cb, NULL);
 * ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_CON_EVENT_CLIENT_DATA, _data_cb, NULL);
 *
 * ecore_main_loop_begin();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The function ecore_con_server_connect() can be used to write a client that
 * connects to a server. The resulting code will be very similar to the server
 * code:
 *
 * @code
 * if (!(svr = ecore_con_server_connect(ECORE_CON_REMOTE_TCP, "127.0.0.1", 8080, NULL)))
 *   exit(1);
 *
 * ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_ADD, _add_cb, NULL);
 * ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DEL, _del_cb, NULL);
 * ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_CON_EVENT_SERVER_DATA, _data_cb, NULL);
 *
 * ecore_main_loop_begin();
 * @endcode
 *
 * After these two pieces of code are executed, respectively, in the server and
 * client code, the server will be up and running and the client will try to
 * connect to it. The connection, with its subsequent messages being sent from
 * server to client and client to server, can be represented in the following
 * sequence diagram:

 *
 * Please notice the important difference between these two codes: the first is

 * @b client.

 *
 * Utility functions that set up, use and shut down the Ecore URL
 * Connection library.
 *
 * These functions are a shortcut to make it easy to perform http requests
 * (POST, GET, etc).
 *
 * Brief usage:
 * 1. Create an Ecore_Con_Url object with ecore_con_url_new(url);
 * 2. Register to receive the #ECORE_CON_EVENT_URL_COMPLETE event
 *    (and optionally the #ECORE_CON_EVENT_URL_DATA and
 *    #ECORE_CON_EVENT_URL_PROGRESS event to receive
 *    the response, e.g. for HTTP/FTP downloads)
 * 3. Perform the operation with ecore_con_url_get(...);
 *
 * Note that it is good to reuse @ref Ecore_Con_Url objects wherever possible,
 * but bear in mind that each one can only perform one operation at a time.  You
 * need to wait for the #ECORE_CON_EVENT_URL_COMPLETE event before re-using or
 * destroying the object.
 *
 * If it's necessary to change the @ref Ecore_Con_Url object url, use
 * ecore_con_url_url_set().
 *
 * Simple Usage 1 (HTTP GET):
 * @code
 *   ecore_con_url_url_set(url_con, "http://www.google.com");
 *   ecore_con_url_get(url_con);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Simple usage 2 (HTTP POST):
 * @code
 *   ecore_con_url_url_set(url_con, "http://www.example.com/post_handler.cgi");
 *   ecore_con_url_post(url_con, data, data_length, "multipart/form-data");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Simple Usage 3 (FTP download):
 * @code
 *   fd = creat(filename, 0644)
 *   ecore_con_url_url_set(url_con, "ftp://ftp.example.com/pub/myfile");
 *   ecore_con_url_fd_set(url_con, fd);
 *   ecore_con_url_get(url_con);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Simple Usage 4 (FTP upload as ftp://ftp.example.com/file):
 * @code
 *   ecore_con_url_url_set(url_con, "ftp://ftp.example.com");
 *   ecore_con_url_ftp_upload(url_con, "/tmp/file", "user", "pass", NULL);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Simple Usage 5 (FTP upload as ftp://ftp.example.com/dir/file):
 * @code
 *   ecore_con_url_url_set(url_con, "ftp://ftp.example.com");
 *   ecore_con_url_ftp_upload(url_con, "/tmp/file", "user", "pass","dir");
 * @endcode
