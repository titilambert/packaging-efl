/**
 * Add (register) a callback function to a given canvas event.
 *
 * @param e Canvas to attach a callback to
 * @param type The type of event that will trigger the callback
 * @param func The (callback) function to be called when the event is
 *        triggered
 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to the canvas @p e when the
 * event of type @p type occurs on it. The function pointer is @p
 * func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during the addition of
 * the callback to the canvas, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_event_callback_add() as the @p
 * data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the canvas
 * pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter @p
 * event_info is a pointer to a data structure that may or may not be
 * passed to the callback, depending on the event type that triggered
 * the callback. This is so because some events don't carry extra
 * context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_POST,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_FOCUS_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_OBJECT_FOCUS_IN and
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_CANVAS_OBJECT_FOCUS_OUT. This determines the kind of
 * event that will trigger the callback to be called. Only the last
 * two of the event types listed here provide useful event information
 * data -- a pointer to the recently focused Evas object. For the
 * others the @p event_info pointer is going to be @c NULL.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_event_callback_add(d.canvas, EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE
 * @until two canvas event callbacks
 *
 * Looking to the callbacks registered above,
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip called when our rectangle gets focus
 * @until let's have our events back
 *
 * we see that the canvas flushes its rendering pipeline
 * (#EVAS_CALLBACK_RENDER_FLUSH_PRE) whenever the @c _resize_cb
 * routine takes place: it has to redraw that image at a different
 * size. Also, the callback on an object being focused comes just
 * after we focus it explicitly, on code.
 *
 * See the full @ref Example_Evas_Events "example".
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make
 * sense if you passed different functions and/or callback data, only.

/**
 * Add (register) a callback function to a given Evas object event.
 *
 * @param obj Object to attach a callback to
 * @param type The type of event that will trigger the callback
 * @param func The function to be called when the event is triggered
 * @param data The data pointer to be passed to @p func
 *
 * This function adds a function callback to an object when the event
 * of type @p type occurs on object @p obj. The function is @p func.
 *
 * In the event of a memory allocation error during addition of the
 * callback to the object, evas_alloc_error() should be used to
 * determine the nature of the error, if any, and the program should
 * sensibly try and recover.
 *
 * A callback function must have the ::Evas_Object_Event_Cb prototype
 * definition. The first parameter (@p data) in this definition will
 * have the same value passed to evas_object_event_callback_add() as
 * the @p data parameter, at runtime. The second parameter @p e is the
 * canvas pointer on which the event occurred. The third parameter is
 * a pointer to the object on which event occurred. Finally, the
 * fourth parameter @p event_info is a pointer to a data structure
 * that may or may not be passed to the callback, depending on the
 * event type that triggered the callback. This is so because some
 * events don't carry extra context with them, but others do.
 *
 * The event type @p type to trigger the function may be one of
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_AXIS_UPDATE,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_MOVE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_UP,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_IN, #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_OUT,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_SHOW, #EVAS_CALLBACK_HIDE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOVE,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESIZE, #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESTACK, #EVAS_CALLBACK_DEL,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD, #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS,
 * #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED or #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED.
 *
 * This determines the kind of event that will trigger the callback.
 * What follows is a list explaining better the nature of each type of
 * event, along with their associated @p event_info pointers:
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_In struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered when the mouse pointer enters the area
 *   (not shaded by other objects) of the object @p obj. This may
 *   occur by the mouse pointer being moved by
 *   evas_event_feed_mouse_move() calls, or by the object being shown,
 *   raised, moved, resized, or other objects being moved out of the
 *   way, hidden or lowered, whatever may cause the mouse pointer to
 *   get on top of @p obj, having been on top of another object
 *   previously.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_OUT: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Out struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered exactly like #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN is,
 *   but it occurs when the mouse pointer exits an object's area. Note
 *   that no mouse out events will be reported if the mouse pointer is
 *   implicitly grabbed to an object (mouse buttons are down, having
 *   been pressed while the pointer was over that object). In these
 *   cases, mouse out events will be reported once all buttons are
 *   released, if the mouse pointer has left the object's area. The
 *   indirect ways of taking off the mouse pointer from an object,
 *   like cited above, for #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_IN, also apply here,
 *   naturally.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Down struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being pressed while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object. If the pointer mode for Evas is
 *   #EVAS_OBJECT_POINTER_MODE_AUTOGRAB (default), this causes this
 *   object to <b>passively grab the mouse</b> until all mouse buttons
 *   have been released: all future mouse events will be reported to
 *   only this object until no buttons are down. That includes mouse
 *   move events, mouse in and mouse out events, and further button
 *   presses. When all buttons are released, event propagation will
 *   occur as normal (see #Evas_Object_Pointer_Mode).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Up struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by a mouse button being released while
 *   the mouse pointer is over an object's area (or when passively
 *   grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Move struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse pointer being moved while
 *   over an object's area (or while passively grabbed to an object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOUSE_WHEEL: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Mouse_Wheel struct\n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the mouse wheel being rolled while the
 *   mouse pointer is over an object (or passively grabbed to an
 *   object).
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Down struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Up struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MULTI_MOVE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Multi_Move struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_AXIS_UPDATE: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Axis_Update struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FREE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered just before Evas is about to free all
 *   memory used by an object and remove all references to it. This is
 *   useful for programs to use if they attached data to an object and
 *   want to free it when the object is deleted. The object is still
 *   valid when this callback is called, but after it returns, there
 *   is no guarantee on the object's validity.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Down struct\n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is pressed and the focus is on
 *   the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key press regardless of what object
 *   has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_UP: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Key_Up struct \n\n
 *   This callback is called when a key is released and the focus is
 *   on the object, or a key has been grabbed to a particular object
 *   which wants to intercept the key release regardless of what
 *   object has the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_IN: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is called when an object gains the focus. When it is
 *   called the object has already gained the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_FOCUS_OUT: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered when an object loses the focus. When it
 *   is called the object has already lost the focus.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_SHOW: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by the object being shown by
 *   evas_object_show().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HIDE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being hidden by
 *   evas_object_hide().
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_MOVE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being
 *   moved. evas_object_move() can trigger this, as can any
 *   object-specific manipulations that would mean the object's origin
 *   could move.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESIZE: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being resized. Resizes can
 *   be triggered by evas_object_resize() or by any object-specific
 *   calls that may cause the object to resize.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_RESTACK: @p event_info is @c NULL \n\n
 *   This event is triggered by an object being re-stacked. Stacking
 *   changes can be triggered by
 *   evas_object_stack_below()/evas_object_stack_above() and others.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_DEL: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_HOLD: @p event_info is a pointer to an
 *   #Evas_Event_Hold struct
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_CHANGED_SIZE_HINTS: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_PRELOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * - #EVAS_CALLBACK_IMAGE_UNLOADED: @p event_info is @c NULL.
 *
 * @note Be careful not to add the same callback multiple times, if
 * that's not what you want, because Evas won't check if a callback
 * existed before exactly as the one being registered (and thus, call
 * it more than once on the event, in this case). This would make
 * sense if you passed different functions and/or callback data, only.
 *
 * Example:
 * @dontinclude evas-events.c
 * @skip evas_object_event_callback_add(
 * @until }
 *
 * See the full example @ref Example_Evas_Events "here".

 * Evas_Object_Vg is the scene graph for managing vector graphics  objects.
 * User can create shape objects as well as fill objects and give it to the
 * Evas_Object_Vg for drawing on the screen as well as managing the lifecycle
 * of the objects. enabling reuse of shape objects.
 *
 * As Evas_Object_Vg is a Evas_Object all the operation that applicable to
 * a Evas_Object can be performed on it(clipping , map, etc).
 *
 * To create any complex vector graphics you can create a hirarchy of shape
 * and fill objects and give the hirarchy to Evas_Object which  will be
 * responsible for drawing and showing on the screen.
 *
 * As the shape object and fill object (linear and radial gradient) have
 * retain mode API, you only have to create it once and set the properties
 * and give it to evas_object_vg.
 *
 * Any change in the property of shape/fill object will automaticaly notified
 * to the evas_object_vg which will trigger a redrawing to reflect the change.
 *
 * To create a vector path, you can give list of path commands to the shape
 * object using efl_gfx_shape_path_set() API.
 *
 * Enabling graphical shapes to be constructed and reused.
 *
 * Below are the list of feature currently supported by Vector object.
 *
 * @li Drawing SVG Path.
 *     You can construct a path by using api in efl_gfx_utils.h
 *
 * @li Gradient filling and stroking.
 *     You can fill or stroke the path using linear or radial gradient.
 *     @see Evas_Vg_Gradient_Linear and Evas_Vg_Gradient_Radial
 *
 * @li Transformation support for path and gradient fill. You can apply
       affin transformation on path object.
 *     @see Eina_Matrix.
