efl (1.8.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: libedje1, libeio1, libeeze1, efl-dbg are now M-A: same
  * debian: add new package for Emotion
  * debian: add new packages for Ethumb/Ethumb-Client

efl (1.8.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian: enable GLES insead of regular GL on armel and armhf
  * debian/patches/04_magic_debug_abi: disable 'magic debug' to not break ABI.
    Eina uses a 'magic' number to perform checks on its data structures, but
    enabling this 'magic' number changes to ABI. Eina in debian is currently
    compiled without magic debug, so we need to this patch to keep ABI
    compatibility
  * debian/patches/05_eina_time_get: fix issues with clock_gettime on hurd/*bsd
  * Upload to unstable

efl (1.8.5-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * patches/04_eina_file_hash_fix: remove, applied upstream
  * debian/control: allow efl-dbg to be installed on platforms lacking ecore-fb
  * debian/control: allow efl to build on non-linux architectures
    libudev-dev, libmount-dev and libbkid-dev are all linux-specific
    packages. When they're not present the build system disables libeeze, so
    that package is now linux-any.
  * debian/copyright: fix missing licenses for some files (Closes: #736914)

efl (1.8.4-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: use misc:Pre-Depends instead of hardcoded multiarch-support
  * debian/control: all libecore packages are now Multi-Arch: same
  * debian: add the libefreet-bin package, necessary for proper efreet operation
  * debian: update the efreet packaging to work with Multi-Arch
    libefreet1 and efreetd communicate via d-bus, and there is a circular
    dependency between libefreet1 and efreetd, which make things difficult
    with Multi-Arch (as the helper binary had to be in a separate package).
    To avoid that circular dependency issue, libefreet1 is now a
    transitional package to libefreet1a and libefreet-bin and the
    libefreet1a shlibs file forces a Depends: libefreet-bin. Thanks to
    Josselin Mouette for the suggestion!
  * debian: add packaging information for Eeze

efl (1.8.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control: Build-Depend on libudev-dev only for Linux architectures
  * debian/control: libevas1 Depends: libevas-loaders to support more formats
  * debian/control: drop B-D on librsvg2-dev, svg is handled via evas-loaders
  * debian/control: use Architecture: linux-any instead of hardcoded list
  * debian/control: mark libeet1 and libevas1 packages as Multi-Arch: same
  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes required
  * patches/03_ecore_evas_extn_abi: remove, applied upstream
  * patches/03_no_ecore_audio_test: disable the Ecore_Audio testsuite.
    We don't ship libecore-audio but the testsuite seems to have issues at
    least on s390x. Since the library has other problems that make
    debugging difficult, disable the tests until it gets fixed.
  * patches/04_eina_file_hash_fix: cherry-pick cad0db51 to fix FTBFS on Sparc
  * debian/rules: use a large testsuite timeout to fix issues on slow buildds
  * debian: merge all libe*-doc into a single efl-doc package.
    The initial upload erroenously copied the complete doc in all the -doc
    packages, reuslting in much bigger packages than expected. Now that all
    libs are in the same source package, keeping separate -doc binary
    packages does not make much sense, so merge them all.

efl (1.8.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload of the merged EFL tree (Closes: #729751)
  * debian: add control and packages information from previous EFL packages
  * debian: bring back and refresh applicable patches from previous EFL packages
  * debian: move to a single debug symbols package for EFL
  * debian: core evas engines now ship with libevas1, drop libevas-engines-core
  * debian: upstream no longer provides static libraries
  * debian: fix install path for ecore and edje utility libraries
  * debian: remove evas loaders install; they'll be split in a separate package
  * debian: update Build-Depends as per new EFL requirements
  * debian/rules: always run autoreconf during build to get a recent version
  * debian/rules: force build with dev profile
  * debian/rules: add support for parallel builds
  * debian: add packaging information for EO.
    Since this a base EFL that all other libs depend on, integrate it with
    the eina package
  * debian: add packaging information for Eldbus.
    To avoid a circular dependency between eldbus and ecore (ecore modules
    depend on eldbus, eldbus depends on ecore), put the eldbus library in
    the libecore package
  * debian: refactor packages dependencies to be easier to maintain.
    Upstream always generates the .pc files to have dependencies between
    libs with the upstream version (ie. for EFL 1.8.3 all .pc files refer to
    1.8.3), so there's no point in trying to be clever: just use the
    source:Upstream-Version. Also, include Efl_Config.h in eina and make
    sure all -dev packages depend on libeina-dev to get that config header
  * debian/libevas1.symbols: mark all evas_common symbols as optional.
    Even if the evas_common symbols are exported, they are internal to
    Evas: they are only part of the internal engine API, but the symbols
    have to be exported because Evas module use them and we need to be able
    to resolve references to those symbols
  * debian/libecore-evas1.symbols: drop windows-only symbol removed from EFL 1.8
  * add patches/03_ecore_evas_extn_abi: cherry-pick e1b1296 to fix ABI issue
  * debian: add new symbols from this version in the symbols files
  * debian: add a DEP5-compliant copyright file
