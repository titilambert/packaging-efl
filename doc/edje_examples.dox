/**
 * @page Example_Edje_Basics Edje basics example
 *
 * In this example, we illustrate how to start using the Edje library,
 * with the very basic one needs to instantiate an Edje object.
 *
 * We place, in the canvas, an Edje object along with a @b red border
 * image to delimit its geometry. After we instantiate the Edje
 * object, we @b have to set a file and a group, within that file, to
 * bind to it. For this example, we're using an EDC file which
 * declares two parts (blue and green rectangles) and an item data:
 * @include basic.edc
 *
 * We start by trying to access an @b unexistant group in the file, so
 * that you can see the usefulness of edje_object_load_error_get() and
 * edje_load_error_str(). Check that the error message will tell you
 * just that -- a group which didn't exist in the file was called for:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip file_path
 * @until file_path
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip edje_object_add
 * @until }
 *
 * Than, we finally bind our Edje object to @c "example_group",
 * printing a message afterwards:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip file_path, "example_group"
 * @until object_show
 *
 * What follows is a series of Edje API calls which are of general
 * use. The first of them is edje_object_data_get(), which we use to
 * get the value we have put in the @c "example_data" data field, in
 * our EDC object declaration:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip data field in group
 * @until ;
 *
 * Than, we exemplify edje_object_part_exists():
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip Testing if
 * @until ;
 *
 * The next call is to query @c "part_one"'s geometry, relative to the
 * whole Edje object's area. The part will be situated in the middle
 * of the Edje object's, because it has a restricted forced size (we
 * set its minimum size equal to its maximum, for that) and, by
 * default, parts are aligned to the center of their containers:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip part_geometry_get
 * @until x, y, w, h
 *
 * We can grab a direct pointer on the rectangle implementing @c
 * "part_one", by using edje_object_part_object_get(). Since we are
 * not allowed to set properties on it, we just check its color, to
 * assure its really blue, as declared in the EDC:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip color_get
 * @until x, y, w, h
 *
 * The @c "min" and @c "max" EDC properties can be queried with the
 * following calls:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip max_get
 * @until min. size is
 *
 * The next two calls are to make <b>size calculations</b> on our
 * object. Because of the minimum size declared for @c "part_one" part's
 * default state description, that will be our exact minimum
 * size calculated for the group (remember the @c "min" declaration at
 * group level is just a @b hint, not an enforcement). We then
 * exercise the edje_object_size_min_restricted_calc() function,
 * passing a minimum size of 500, in each axis. Since we have @b no
 * object bigger than that, it will be the minimum size calculated, in
 * the end:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip min_calc
 * @until size calculation is
 *
 * @c "part_two" part is there with a purpose: since it extrapolates
 * the Edje object's boundaries, the edje_object_parts_extends_calc()
 * function will report origin coordinates for the rectangle grouping
 * both parts with @b negative values, indicating it extrapolates to
 * the upper left of our group, just as we see it.
 *
 * To interact with the last features exemplified in the program,
 * there's a command line interface.  A help string can be asked for
 * with the 'h' key:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip commands
 * @until ;
 *
 * Those commands will change the scaling factors of our Edje objects.
 * The first of them, @c 's', will change Edje's @b global scaling
 * factor between @c 1.0 (no scaling) and @c 2.0 (double
 * scale). Scaling will be applied to @c "part_one", only, because
 * that's the part flagged to be scaled at EDC level:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip strcmp(ev->key, "s") == 0
 * @until }
 *
 * Note, finally, that the @c 's' command will depend on the 'r' one
 * to have its effects applied. The latter will change @c "part_one"'s
 * @b individual scaling factor, which @b overrides Edje's global
 * scaling factor. Only when the individual one is set to zero, will
 * the global one take effect:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic.c
 * @skip strcmp(ev->key, "r") == 0
 * @until }
 *

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_nested Edje Nested Part (hierarchy) example
 *
 * Nested part feature represents the concept of hierarchy to edje.
 *
 * A nested part inherits it's location relatively to the parent part.
 * Thus, parent part modifications such move or map effects all nested parts.
 * To declare a nested part just start a new part declaration within
 * (before closing) the current part declaration.

 * @until edje_object_part_text_set(edje_obj, "part_two"
 * @note Since the "part_two" part is a TEXTBLOCK we can use formatting such as

 * @dontinclude edje-text.c
 * @skip edje_object_part_text_select_allow_set
 * @until edje_object_part_text_select_all
 *
 * We then select the entire text, and print the selected text:

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_table Table example
 *
 * In this example, we illustrate how to organize your objects on a table, using
 * the edje_object_part_table functions. To be easier to understand the objects
 * in this example will be four simple rects, when the user click over one
 * item with the left button its is removed from the table, if any other button
 * was used all items are removed. For each action is printed a message with
 * the current number of rows and columns.
 *
 * We started creating an EDC file with one part of the type TABLE called
 * @b "table_part", that is the part which we will refer to access the table:
 * @include table.edc
 *
 * On the other hand, in the C file we first create the rectangles and added a
 * callback for mouse down, as you can see bellow:
 * @dontinclude edje-table.c
 * @skip _rects_create
 * @until }
 * @skip }
 * @until }
 *
 * With the objects created we have to pack them into the table, to do this, we
 * just have to use the function edje_object_part_table_pack().
 * @dontinclude edje-table.c
 * @skip (!edje_object_part_table_pack
 * @until 4
 *
 * The other bit of code that is relevant to us now is our event handler for
 * when the user click over the rectangle. Here we use the function
 * edje_object_part_table_unpack() to remove the item from the table or
 * edje_object_part_table_clear() to remove all items, it depends on which mouse
 * button the user uses.
 * @dontinclude edje-table.c
 * @skip _on_mouse_down
 * @until }
 *
 * Finally, the last important thing in this example is about how to know how many
 * columns and rows are there in the table, It should be noted that this function
 * don't tell you how many items are there in the table, just the number of the
 * columns and rows of the table.
 * @dontinclude edje-table.c

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_box Box example - basic usage
 *
 * This example shows how to append, insert and remove elements from an Edje box
 * part. It will make use of the edje_object_part_box functions.
 *
 * To play with this example, use mouse left click to delete an existing
 * rectangle from the box and right mouse click to add a new rectangle just
 * before the clicked one. Use the keyboard keys "a" to append a rectangle, "i"
 * to prepend, and "c" to remove all rectangles from the box.
 *
 * We will store our example global information in the data structure defined
 * below, and also set some callbacks for resizing the canvas and exiting the
 * window:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-box.c
 * @skip static const char
 * @until ecore_evas_geometry_get
 * @until }
 *
 * In the @c main function, we create our @c Ecore_Evas, add a background to it,
 * and finally load our @c Edje file that contains a @c Box part. This part is
 * named @c "example/box" in this case, and we use this name to append elements
 * to it.
 *
 * The code until now is the one that follows:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-box.c
 * @skip main(int argc __UNUSED__, char *argv[])
 * @until ecore_evas_data_set(ee, "background", bg)
 *
 * Also notice that we set the callback @c _bg_key_down for @c "key down" events
 * on the background object, and that object is the one with focus.
 *
 * Now we add some small rectangles to the box part, using the
 * edje_object_part_box_append() API, and set some callbacks for @c "mouse down"
 * events on every object. These callbacks will be used to add or delete objects
 * from the box part.
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-box.c
 * @skip bg = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas)
 * @until evas_object_event
 * @until }
 *
 * Now let's take a look at the callbacks for key down and mouse down events:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-box.c
 * @skip ecore_evas_geometry_get
 * @skip static
 * @until evas_object_event
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * This callback for mouse down events will get left clicks and remove the
 * object that received that left click from the box part, and then delete it.
 * This is done with the edje_object_part_box_remove() function.
 *
 * However, on right clicks it will create a new rectangle object, and add it
 * just before the right clicked object, using
 * edje_object_part_box_insert_before().
 *
 * And this is the key down callback:
 *
 * @until remove_all
 * @until }
 *
 * It will insert elements at the beginning of the box if "i" was pressed, using
 * edje_object_part_box_insert_at(). It will also append objects to the box if
 * "a" was pressed, just exactly like we did in the @c main function. And will
 * remove all objects (deleting them) if "c" was pressed.
 *
 * As you can see, this example uses the @c "horizontal_flow" layout for the
 * box, where each item is put linearly in rows, in as many rows as necessary to
 * store all of them.
 *
 * The example's window should look like this picture:
 *

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_box2 Box example - custom layout
 *
 * This example shows how to register a custom layout to be used by the Edje box
 * part. It will use edje_box_layout_register() for that.
 *
 * To play with this example, use the keyboard modifier keys and number keys
 * together. The Ctrl key is used for adding elements, and Shift is used for
 * removing them. For instance, Ctrl + 3 will insert a new rectangle object in
 * the 3rd position of the box, while Shift + 6 will try to remove the 6th
 * element of the box.
 *
 * This example is very similar to the other box example, has a structure with
 * global data, a callback for key down events where we create or delete
 * rectangle objects and add or remove them to/from the box part.
 *
 * But the important part is the next one:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-box2.c
 * @skip static void
 * @until }
 *
 * This code implements our custom layout, which will position every object
 * added to the box in a diagonal through the size of the box part. Notice that
 * it just calculates the position and offset based on the size of the box and
 * number of children, and then moves each child to the respective position.
 *
 * Later on the @c main function, everything we need to do is to register this
 * custom layout function with edje:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-box2.c
 * @skipline edje_box_layout_register
 *
 * And use it inside the box.edc file:
 *
 * @dontinclude box.edc
 * @skip example/group2
 * @skip example/title
 * @skip part
 * @until BOX
 * @until example/box

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_drag Dragable parts example
 *
 * This example shows how to manipulate a dragable part through the
 * edje_object_part_drag API.
 *
 * First, in the edc code, we are declaring a part which will be our movable
 * part, called "knob". It is a normal rectangle, which contains a block called
 * "dragable", that will define the area where this rectangle can be moved, and
 * in which axis it can be moved.
 *
 * This is our part:
 *
 * @dontinclude drag.edc
 * @skip // drag_area
 * @skip part
 * @until example/knob
 * @until example/knob
 *
 * Notice that it defines, through its @c "x:" and @c "y:' properties, that the
 * part will be only moved on the y axis (vertical). Check the edc reference
 * docs for more info about this.
 *
 * Now, in our example C code, we just do the same as on the other examples,
 * setting some global data on a structure, load the edje file and so:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-drag.c
 * @skip static const char *PARTNAME
 * @until ;
 *
 * @skip main(int argc __UNUSED__, char *argv[])
 * @until evas_object_show
 *
 * We want to use the drag_page and drag_step functions, and in order to do so we
 * need to define the step size and page size of our dragable part. They are
 * defined as float values which represent a portion of the entire size of the
 * dragable area:
 *
 * @until drag page step
 *
 * We are going to use the keyboard to move the @c knob part, through the key
 * down callback @c _bg_key_down, but we also want to know when the user has
 * moved the knob by using the mouse (which is possible, since we defined that
 * this part will receive mouse events). Thus, we set a callback for the signal
 * "drag", which comes from the dragable part:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-drag.c
 * @skipline evas_object_event_callback_add
 *
 * @skipline edje_object_signal_callback_add
 *
 * Now, let's take a look at our key down callback:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-drag.c
 * @skip _on_bg_key_down
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 * @skip else
 * @until }
 *
 * On this callback we define that the user will use the "up" and "down" arrows
 * to move the dragable part, respectively, -1.0 and 1.0 times the step size.
 * And that the "Page Up" (Prior) and "Page Down" (Next) keys will move -1.0 and
 * 1.0 times the page size. Both of these will occur on the vertical axis, since
 * we pass 0.0 as value to the respective horizontal axis parameters. And our
 * dragable part also only supports being moved in the vertical axis (defined in
 * the edc).
 *
 * We also define that the "m" key will be used to explicitly position the knob
 * part in the middle of the dragable area.
 *
 * And here is the callback for the @c "drag" signal that is received from the
 * theme:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-drag.c
 * @skip _on_knob_moved
 * @until }
 *

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_perspective Perspective example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how someone can set a perspective to be used by an
 * Edje object, but setting a global perspective. The API for setting a
 * perspective for just one Edje object is almost the same and it's trivial, so
 * we are not doing that on this example.
 *
 * Let's go first to the main function, where we start creating our objects and
 * loading the theme. We also set some variables that will be used globally in
 * our program:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-perspective.c
 * @skip main(
 * @until focal =
 *
 * A boolean is used to indicate that we are animating.
 *
 * We also set the @c app.x and @c app.y to (0, 0) because the original position
 * of our text + rectangle part will be on top left. This is a convention that
 * we are using in this example, and setting x, y to 1, 1 would mean bottom
 * right.  We do this to later define the name of the signals that we are
 * sending to the theme.
 *
 * After this, some boilerplate code to load the theme:
 *
 * @until evas_object_show(app.bg)
 *
 * Now we are going to setup a callback to tell us that the animation has ended.
 * We do this just to avoid sending signals to the theme while it's animating.
 *
 * @until edje_object_signal
 *
 * Finally, let's create our perspective object, define its position, focal
 * distance and z plane position, and set it as global:
 *
 * @until global_set
 *
 * Notice that if we wanted to set it just to our edje object, instead of
 * setting the perspective as global to the entire canvas, we could just use
 * edje_object_perspective_set() instead of edje_perspective_global_set(). The
 * rest of the code would be exactly the same.
 *
 * Now, let's take a look at what we do in our callbacks.
 *
 * The callback for key_down is converting the arrow keys to a signal that
 * represents where we want our text and rectangle moved to. It does that by
 * using the following function:
 *
 * @dontinclude edje-perspective.c
 * @skip part_move(
 * @until }
 *
 * Notice that, after sending the signal to the Edje object, we set our boolean
 * to store that we are animating now. It will only be unset when we receive a
 * signal from the theme that the animation has ended.
 *
 * Now, on the key_down code, we just call this function when the arrows or
 * "PgUp" or "PgDown" keys are pressed:
 *
 * @until unhandled
 * @until }
 *
 * Notice that we also do something else when the numeric keyboard "+" and "-"
 * keys are pressed. We change the focal distance of our global perspective, and
 * that will affect the part that has a map rotation applied to it, with
 * perspective enabled. We also need to call edje_object_calc_force(), otherwise
 * the Edje object has no way to know that we changed the global perspective.
 *
 * Try playing with these keys and see what happens to the animation when the
 * value of the focal distance changes.
 *
 * Finally we add a callback for the animation ended signal:
 *
 * @skip  _animation_end_cb
 * @until }
 *

/**
 * @page Example_Edje_Signals_Messages Edje signals and messages
 *
 * In this example, we illustrate how Edje signals and Edje messages
 * work.
 *
 * We place, in the canvas, an Edje object along with a @b red border
 * image to delimit its geometry. The object's group definition is so
 * that we have four parts:
 * - a blue rectangle, aligned to the right
 * - a white rectangle, aligned to the left
 * - a text part, aligned to the center
 * - a clipper rectangle on the blue rectangle
 *
 * The left rectangle is bound to a <b>color class</b>, so that we can
 * multiply its colors by chosen values on the go:
 * @dontinclude signals-messages.edc
 * @until visible
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * The @c \#define's on the beginning will serve as message
 * identifiers, for our accorded message interface between the code
 * and the this theme file.
 *
 * Let's move to the code, then. After instantiating the Edje object,
 * we register two <b>signal callbacks</b> on it. The first one uses
 * @b globbing, making all of the wheel mouse actions over the left
 * rectangle to trigger @c _mouse_wheel. Note that those kind of
 * signals are generated @b internally (and automatically) in Edje. The
 * second is a direct signal match, to a (custom) signal we defined in
 * the EDC, ourselves:
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip edje_object_add
 * @until _mouse_over
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip print signals coming from theme
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * That second callback is on a signal we emit on the theme, where we
 * just translate Edje @c "mouse,move" internal events to the custom @c
 * "mouse,over" one. When that signals reaches the code, we are,
 * besides printing the signals' strings, sending a @b message back to
 * the theme. We generate random values of color components and send
 * them as an #EDJE_MESSAGE_INT_SET message type:
 * @dontinclude signals-messages.edc
 * @skip custom signal
 * @until }
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip mouse over signals
 * @until }
 *
 * In our theme we'll be changing the @c "cc" color class' values with
 * those integer values of the message, so that moving the mouse over
 * the right rectangle will change the left one's colors:
 * @dontinclude signals-messages.edc
 * @skip public message
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * Now we're also sending messages <b>from the Edje object</b>,
 * besides signals.  We do so when one clicks with the left button
 * over the left rectangle.  With that, we change the text part's
 * text, cycling between 3 pre-set strings declared in the EDC. With
 * each new text string attribution, we send a string message to our
 * code, with the current string as argument:
 * @dontinclude signals-messages.edc
 * @skip program
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @skip change text
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @dontinclude signals-messages.edc
 * @skip set_text_string
 * @until }
 *
 * To get the message in code, we have to register a message handler, as
 * follows:
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip message_handler_set
 * @until message_handler_set
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip print out
 * @until }
 *
 * To interact with the last missing feature -- emitting signals
 * <b>from code</b> -- there's a command line interface to exercise
 * it.  A help string can be asked for with the 'h' key:
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip commands
 * @until ;
 *
 * The @c 't' command will send either @c "part_right,show" or @c
 * "part_right,hide" signals to the Edje object (those being the
 * emission part of the signal), which was set to react on them as the
 * names indicate. We'll set the right rectangle's visibility on/off,
 * respectively, for those two signals:
 * @dontinclude signals-messages.edc
 * @skip hide right rectangle
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @dontinclude edje-signals-messages.c
 * @skip key, "t"
 * @until }
 *
 * The example's window should look like this picture:
 *
 * @image html edje-signals-messages-example.png
 * @image rtf edje-signals-messages-example.png

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_color_class Edje Color Class example
 * @dontinclude edje-color-class.c
 *
 * This example shows how to manipulate and change Color classes. In this example
 * we will create two surfaces to show what happens when you change the color
 * class at the process and object level.
 *
 * It's a very simple example, there are two surfaces created from the same EDC,
 * but just in one of them we will set a specific color class, although both will be
 * affected by color class set at the process level as you will see.
 *
 * It's important you know that all colors has the format R G B A. Just to be easier
 * to understand this example, we will create a small set of colors that will be used
 * along of the example. This piece of code is shown below:
 * @skip static color colors_init_data
 * @until return EINA_FALSE
 * @until }
 *
 * Focusing on the relevant parts of the code we go right to the part where we set
 * the new color class. For that we will use the functions edje_color_class_set (
 * which will affect all edjes) and edje_object_color_class_set (which affects just
 * the specific object).
 * @skip edje_color_class_set
 * @until Text shadow
 * @until Text shadow
 * @note
 *       - argv[1] is the name of a color class used in the EDC.
 *       - The second and third colors only apply to text part.
 *       - The color class set for the object overrides the color previously set.
 *
 * After we have set the color class we will check the color classes, for that
 * we created a function which prints all color classes and tries to get theirs
 * values and print too.
 * @dontinclude edje-color-class.c
 * @skip _color_classes_print(void)
 * @until free
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * There are two other things that are worth mentioning, we added two callbacks for the
 * objects, one for mouse down (that we use to delete the color class) and another
 * for the signal emmited when a color class is deleted.
 * @skip  evas_object_event
 * @until NULL
 * @skip  edje_object_si
 * @until process
 *
 * And then we delete the color class:
 * @dontinclude edje-color-class.c
 * @skip _on_mouse_down
 * @until }
 *
 * Our example will look like this, if you run with the parameters "green_class gray pink yellow":

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_animations Edje Animations example
 *
 * In this example we will figure out how to manipulate the animations on
 * an Edje object. After reading this document you will be able to manipulate
 * the frametime, freeze, pause and stop, all animations on an Edje object.
 *
 * To play with this example you will use the keyboard. Below are listed the
 * keys and what each does.
 *
 * - '+' Increase the frametime;
 * - '-' Decrease the frametime;
 * - '=' Prints the actual frametime and says if the animations is playing;
 * - 'f' Freezes the animations in the Edje object;
 * - 'F' Freezes the animations in all objects in the running program;
 * - 't' Thaws the animations in the Edje object;
 * - 'T' Thaws the animations in all objects in the running program;
 * - 's' Pauses the animations;
 * - 'p' Plays the animations previously stopped;
 * - 'a' Starts the animation in the Edje object;
 * - 'A' Stops the animations in the Edje object;
 *
 * Now that we've explained how to use our example, we will see how it is made.
 * Let's start by looking at the piece of code responsible to the actions commented
 * above.
 * @dontinclude edje-animations.c
 * @skip _on_key_down
 * @until Stopping
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @note The actions for the keys 'f' and 'F' will have the same effect in
 *       our example, just because there is only one object in the running
 *       program, The same happens with the keys 't' and 'T'.
 *
 * As you may have seen these set of functions are pretty easy to handle. The other
 * important part of this example is the EDC file. The animations used in the
 * code were created there
 * @dontinclude animations.edc
 * @skip program
 * @until after: "animation,state1"
 * @until }
 * @skip program
 * @until }
 * @skip program

 * In this example we will show how to load an image and move it across the window.
 *
 * To load the image to our program, it needs to be declared in the .edc using the images block:
 * @dontinclude basic2.edc
 * @skip images
 * @until }
 *
 * @note COMP means that we are using a lossless compression
 *
 * Then to be able to use it in our window we must declare a part for this image:

 * @skip part{
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * Now we move to our .c file, you will notice this define:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic2.c
 * @skipline #define WALK
 *
 * This means how fast we want to move the image across the screen
 *
 * To load our edje file we will use this command, we do just like the last example (Basic example):
 *
 * @skip if(!edje_object
 * @until evas_object_show
 *
 * If we want to move our image, we need to add a callback to be able to do this, so we define:
 *
 * @skipline evas_object_event_callback
 *
 * To get the position of the image we use this:
 * @dontinclude edje-basic2.c
 * @skipline evas_object_geometry
 *
 * Now we use the if's to check in what direction the user wants to move the image then we move it:
 *
 * @skip if(strcmp

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_signals_2 Edje Signals example 2
 *
 * In this example we will make use of signals to help to move an image away from the mouse pointer.
 *
 * Signals are software interruption, this means that when it happens and if the program is sensitive to it
 * the program will stop whatever it is doing and handle the signal.
 *
 * In this example we are only sensitive to the "mouse,move" signal so we need to register a callback to it.
 * To do this we will add a signal callback to our edje object that will detect "mouse,move" signal
 * coming from the part "part_image" and when this happens we will call the function _on_mouse_over passing
 * the evas pointer as a parameter. The evas pointer is passed as a parameter because we need to know
 * where is the mouse pointer in the screen.
 *
 * We can see bellow how we can listen to the signal:
 *
 * @dontinclude signals2.c
 * @skip edje_object_signal
 * @until );
 *
 *
 * Now, let's pass to the callback function. If we want to keep the ball away from the mouse pointer
 * we need to now where is the ball and where is the mouse and we can easily discovery these things using
 * this:
 *
 * For the object position in the canvas:
 * @dontinclude signals2.c
 * @skipline evas_object_geometry
 *
 * For the mouse position relative to the screen:
 * @skipline evas_pointer_output
 *
 * Now that we have the position of the mouse and the object we just need
 * to set the new location and move the object. To set the new location we do this:
 * @skip if
 * @until y -= (
 *
 * You can change the formula above if you like. Because we are changing the object's position
 * we need to do something if the new position is beyond the canvas size. So here it is:
 *
 * @skip if
 * @until y = 0
 *
 * Then now what we need to do is move the object:
 * @skipline  evas_object
 *
 * Here is the complete callback function:
 *
 * @dontinclude signals2.c
 * @skip _on_mouse_over
 * @until }

/**
 * @page tutorial_edje_animations_2 Edje animations example 2
 *
 * In this example we will make an animation of a bouncing ball.
 *
 * Our focus now will be in the .edc file, because in the C source code we just load the edje object and do
 * nothing else.
 *
 * We want to give the freedom to the object to use the whole canvas of our program, so lets define
 * the min, max of our group:
 *
 * @dontinclude animations2.edc
 * @skipline max
 * @skipline min
 *
 * You will notice that in our .c file the canvas will have this size
 *
 * Now we will define our part that's going to be our image, the ball:
 * @skip part{
 * @until type:
 *
 *
 * At the description block bellow we are saying that this part has an image, defining
 * the max and min size and it's position on the edje_object. The default state is the first
 * state of the part, this means that when the edje object is loaded this one is going to be showed to you.
 *
 * Here it is:
 * @dontinclude animations2.edc
 * @skip description
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * Now in the next description block we are saying where the ball is going to stop.
 * Note that we have the "inherit" property. This means we are inheriting everything from default,
 * except rel1 and rel2, because we are redefining it.
 *
 * Check the code:
 *
 * @skip description
 * @until }
 *
 * We defined how our object will look like and it's position during the animation,
 * now we need to define how it's going to act during the time. To do this we will
 * use the programs block
 *
 * The first program block will start the animation, it will wait for the 'load' signal. This signal
 * is generated when the edje object is loaded. The 'after' property is saying to this program block exactly this:
 * "When you finish, call the program 'animation,state1' ". The 'in' property is saying, wait 0.5 seconds until you execute this program block.
 *
 * Here is the code:
 *
 * @skip program {
 * @until }
 *
 * Now lets make the ball move and bounce it. In the second program block we are defining what we need to do
 * with the action property. So we are saying change to the state "down-state" using the transition BOUNCE
 * and apply this to the part "part_bubble". You can notice that BOUNCE has three parameters, the first one
 * is saying how much time the transition will last, the second one is the factor of curviness
 * and the last one is saying how many times and object will bounce.
 *
 * The code is very easy:
 *
 * @skip program {
 * @until }
 *
 * Now all you have to do is compile the code and run it!
 *
 * When you compile and run it you should see this:
