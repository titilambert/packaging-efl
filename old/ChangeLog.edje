	* Add new interpolation modes for programs to make animation
        much easier. Added: ACCEL_FAC, DECEL_FAC, SIN_FAC, DIVIS,
        BOUNCE, SPRING (also made short name versions of the long ones
        possible too).

2011-05-19  Tom Hacohen (TAsn)

	 * Entry: Don't emit "cursor,changed" when setting the text, because
	   the cursor really didn't change, it's more like a new cursor.

	   was.

          vibrator control and ultimately beginsd to pave the way for
          more complex audio etc. support.

2011-11-06  David Seikel (onefang)

	* Lua: Added color_class and text_class functions.
	    Still need to write a function for setting the classes of an object.
