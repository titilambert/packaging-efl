Eeze is a library for manipulating devices with an extremely simple api.
It interfaces directly with device subsystems, avoiding such middleman daemons as
udisks/upower or hal to immediately gather device information the instant it
becomes known to the OS.  This can be used to determine such things as:
  * If a cdrom has a disk inserted
  * The temperature of a cpu core
  * The remaining power left in a battery
  * The current power consumption of various parts
  * Monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices
  
Each of the above examples can be performed by using only a single eeze
function, as one of the primary focuses of the library is to reduce the
complexity of managing devices.

Eeze 1.1 adds more detailed disk detection as well as filesystem mount point manipulation.
Using a combination of udev and mount, it is possible to easily write disk-based mount services
which do not rely on any external processes or libraries aside from Eeze.
